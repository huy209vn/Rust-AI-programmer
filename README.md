# AI Rust Programmer â€” Monorepo Skeleton

Locked to Spec v1.3 + Appendices v1.4. Local-first, byte-only model. No RAG. No chat-CLI.
This repo is a clean scaffold you can `cargo build` immediately.

## Quick start
```bash
cargo build
cargo run -p ai-rust-programmer-daemon
```

If your toolchain doesn't yet support `edition = "2024"`, this skeleton uses 2021 for out-of-the-box builds.
You can bump editions later when stable.
