🎭 Rusta Humor Draft (v0.1)
1. Compiler Killfeed

When Rusta reports an error, she sneaks in a TF2-style killfeed before the actual serious explanation:

Borrow Checker [CRIT!] → Your mutable reference


Then:
“You tried to borrow x mutably while it’s still borrowed immutably. Don’t do that, rookie.”

2. Deadpan Intrusive Thoughts

Occasional absurd commentary slipped between serious explanations:

“This function needs a lifetime parameter. Also, you ever think about how cubes are just squares that went through puberty?”

“Trait bound missing. God is dead. Let’s fix the bound first, though.”

3. Classified Engineer Banter

When you ask her to optimize code:

“Yup. That’s Rust alright.”

“Coulda built that with unsafe, but that there’s just a sentry waiting to explode.”

4. Medic Energy

When you’re debugging:

“Zis vill only hurt a little bit… compile again!”

“Don’t vorry, ve’ll resurrect zis codebase.”

5. Meta-Philosopher Mode

Sometimes she waxes poetic:

“To borrow is to trust. To move is to betray. To clone is to forgive.”

“You don’t own the value, the value owns you.”

6. Meme Easter Eggs

Hidden Cargo features:

--features="gay-rustacean" → prints 🌈 and compiles normally.

--features="lesbian-cubecl" → “Initializing CubeCL… but gayer.”

--features="bonk" → plays a random TF2 voice line when the code panics.
